**ACEmulator is a custom, completely from-scratch open source server implementation for Asheron's Call built on C#**
 * MySQL and MariaDB are used as the database engine.
 * Latest client supported.
 * Currently intended for developers that wish to contribute to the ACEmulator project.

## Getting Started
The following three sections (Database, Code, and Starting the Server) contain all the required steps to setup your own ACE server and connect to it. Most setup errors can be traced back to not following one or more of these steps. Be sure to follow them carefully.

### Database
1. Install MySQL or MariaDB
   * [MySQL minimum required version - 5.7.17+](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html)
   * [MariaDB minimum required version - 10.2+](https://mariadb.org/download/)
2. Create three databases named `ace_auth`, `ace_shard`, and `ace_world`
3. Load AuthenticationBase.sql and ShardBase.sql for their respective databases. These can be found in the Database\Base directory.
4. Load all incremental SQL updates found in the Database\Updates\Authentication sub directory in the order of oldest to newest. Skip this step if there are no updates in this directory.
5. Load all incremental SQL updates found in the Database\Updates\Shard sub directory in the order of oldest to newest. Skip this step if there are no updates in this directory. 
6. Download from [ACE-World-16PY-Patches](https://github.com/ACEmulator/ACE-World-16PY-Patches) the [latest release](https://github.com/ACEmulator/ACE-World-16PY-Patches/releases/latest) of world data, extract and load into your ace_world database.
   * [ACE World Database (ACE-World-16PY-Patches) minimum required version - 0.9.98+](https://github.com/ACEmulator/ACE-World-16PY-Patches/releases/latest)
7. SKIP THIS STEP IF USING DOWNLOADED WORLD DATA FROM PREVIOUS STEP.
   * If using a custom database, you may need to update the schema for the emulator to operate correctly. If you're using the official release data, this step is not recommended.
   * Load WorldBase.sql from Database\Base into your `ace_world` database
   * Load all incremental SQL updates found in the Database\Updates\World sub directory in the order of oldest to newest. Skip this step if there are no updates in this directory.

### Code
1. Install .NET Core SDK
   * https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/linux-package-manager/ubuntu18-04/sdk-2.2.104
2. Clone the project with git:
   * git clone https://github.com/ACEmulator/ACE.git
3. Copy `ACE.Server\Config.js.example` to `ACE.Server\Config.js` and modify settings, such as DAT folder, passwords and other server settings.
4. In `ACE/Source`, run `dotnet build`


### Starting the Server
1. In ACE/Source/ACE.Server/bin/x64/Debug/netcoreapp2.1, run the server with `dotnet ACE.Server.dll`
2. Create your first account as an admin at the ACE prompt: `accountcreate testaccount testpassword 5`
3. Launch acclient directly with this command: `acclient.exe -a testaccount -v testpassword -h your-server-address:9000`
