# ACEmulator Change Log

### 2017-12-11
[ddevec]
* More updates to parallelism structure
* Network messages are now seralized
* Removed the vast majority of ActionChain code that was being used for parallelism/thread safety

### 2017-12-10
[Mag-nus]
* ACE has been converted from .net framework 4.6.1 to .net core 2.0.
  * This also involves changing the way databases are loaded to a manual method which is .net core compatible.
  * This breaks secure auth. That system will need to be reworked by someone more experienced to function properly.

### 2017-12-03
[Mag-nus]
* Many projects converted to .net standard 2.0 or .net core 2.0
* MySqlResult object removed from ACE.Database
* ACE.Diagnostics removed from ACE. ('diag' command is disabled until we fine a better solution)
* ACE.CmdLineLauncher changed over to ACE.ACClientLauncher. Build is also disabled by default in Configuration Manager.

### 2017-12-02
[Ripley]
* Updated README links relating to Protocol documentation.
* Fixed read issue with AnimationFrame in DatLoader. (Issue reported from Discord & confirmed by OptimShi)
* Rebased SQL scripts.

[Mag-nus]
* Changes to eventually support .net core 2.0
  * Changed target .net framework to 4.6.1
  * Changed build environment to Visual Studio 2017.

### 2017-11-26
[Ripley]
* Deleted VendorItems class.
* Replaced VendorItems class with more generic AceObjectInventory class.. This is entirely based on CreationProfile found in protocol doc so probably could stand to be renamed, same with database table.
* Made changes to Vendor to use AceObjectInventory and added a bit more functionality with respect to alternate currency.
* Added more to DestinationType enum.
* Added some properties to AO/WO.
* Added WieldList object spawning to the CreateWorldObjects function of the WorldObjectFactory. This is not the final, correct way to do this but does visually look right.
* WorldObjects are not really world aware so they have much work to do to be able to really wield and use objects, as well as report them properly to the landblock manager.

### 2017-11-20
[OptimShi]
* Changed EquipTest debug command to utilize the index of a clothing table item and added an optional shade parameter

### 2017-11-18
[Ripley]
* Added some foundational elements to support Chess minigame.
* Client handles it cleanly now.
* Find a chessboard in the world and try it out. Enjoy your table flipping.


### 2017-11-10
[Verbal]
* updated fellowship creation to read the xp sharing flag

### 2017-11-09
[fantoms]
* Added command and API endpoint for retreiving the database content from Github.
* You can now redeploy database content from local disk.
* Updated logging for redeployment.
* Added `ContentServer` example config setting.

### 2017-11-05
[fantoms]
* Added Database Redeployment feature to allow for updating or resetting a database from the latest github content.
* Added `redeploy-world` command from the console to issue world redeployment.
* Added `redeploy` console command to allow for resetting one or more databases, using the redeployment functionality. This command requires a database selectiona dnd the "force" string as a parameter, for added security.
* Implemented API functionality for World redeployment and database Redeployment.
* Added configuration section for Remote Content downloads from Github, `ContentServer`.
* Added database.cs functions to allow for database creation, removal, connectionString changes, and database script loading events.
* Added WorldDatabase function to check for user modified flag.
* Added a workaround that prevents a crash when a bad token is passed in to the API.

### 2017-11-03
[ddevec]
* Change core structure eliminating multi-threading between threads.  
* Removed ChainOnObject() from landblock, make GetObject() public.
* Simplified Action code to reflect for new threading model.

[Ripley]
* Fix AppVeyor issues.

### 2017-11-02
[Ripley]
* Fix Landblock loading of weenie instance position data.

### 2017-11-01
[Ripley]
* Updated EmoteCategory, EmoteType, and SpellType enums.
* Add CombatStyle enum.
* Rebased SQL scripts.
* Changed all PropertyInt properties from uint to int.
** NOTE: ACE-World database version required to be 0.2.7 or higher from this point forward. **
* Todo/Fixme: Combat Stances don't work properly due to GetInventoryItem issue.
* Cleaned up StyleCop issues.
* Updated README with ACE-World requirement.

### 2017-10-30
[Mogwai]
* implemented updating of weenies in ace-world necessary for crowd-sourced content creation
* added database unit tests to AppVeyor build

### 2017-10-27
[OptimShi]
* Updated DatLoader.FileTypes.SetupModel to more closely represent what is in the client. Also added additional structures to this to fully read the file.

[Mogwai]
* Loads of new JSON property renaming
* New API definitions stubbed, some implemented

### 2017-10-25
[fantoms]
* Changed an exception in AuthApi, to prevent the server from crashing on a bad account.
* API Updates for roles in token, you should now be closer to using the correct `[AceAuthorize(AccessLevel)]` reflection with Api functions.
 - Api will take the first subscription's accesslevel, when checking roles; this should probably be set to take the highest level. AccessLevel of Player (0) is used when a subscription is missing.

### 2017-10-24
[OptimShi]
* Fixed bug with Equipment Mask enum that was causing Greaves/Lower Leg Armor not to appear on character

[Mogwai]
* API Host Updates for consistency and messaging.
* Defined and implemented Content API.
* Started the Weenie API definition.
* removed the old/unused web project.

[Ripley]
* @Slushnas found WebApp.Start error in ACE.AuthApi.Host: Changed ACE.Api.Startup to ACE.AuthApi.Startup to fix domain error.
* AuthServer Changes:
  - AuthServer needs a publicly accessible address to point connecting clients if you're trying to use the server outside of a localhost/internal lan only environment.
  - The current defaults basically point everything to "http://+:8001" which fails to resolve. So the following changes have been made..
  - Changed AuthServer.Url to AuthServer.ListenUrl
  - Added AuthServer.PublicUrl
  - Typically, you'll leave the AuthServer.ListenUrl to the default, but you'll want to change AuthServer.PublicUrl to either of the following: 
    * The externally accessible address of the AuthServer so that clients from the internet can authenticate.
    or
    * localhost or the internal lan address so only those inside the local network/local machine can authenticate.

### 2017-10-23
[Jyrus]
* Fix a typeo in ACE.AuthApi.Host, as it was attempting to start the API host in place of the AuthAPI host

### 2017-10-22
[fantoms]
* Changed build output path for Api.Host and AuthApi.Host projects, in an attempt to share the server config for debug and build.
* Added simple service configuration function to Api.Common, to load the initial config for Api host apps.
* Updated README.md to include additional instructions for Api host support.
* Added a few null checks to prevent crashes in the AuthApi login function.
* Added a config error check on the cmd line launcher, for ease of use.
* Added config examples that are open to the world.

### 2017-10-21
[Jyrus]
* Add the initial set of CoinValue in Container.cs to the value of contained Coins
* Modified item move, drop, and pickup methods to account for pyreal changes using StackOverflow's UpdateCurrencyClientCalculations();

### 2017-10-20
[Mogwai]
* Authentication overhaul is done.  Please note there are significant changes to the Readme file.

### 2017-10-19
[Jyrus]
* Created WO.StackUnitValue and WO.StackUnitBurden to be initialized by Weenie.{Value,EncumbranceVal}, with builtin null to zero initialization
* Moved WorldObject value and encumbrance calculations down to the WO class based upon WO.StackUnitValue and WO.StackUnitBurden vs WO.StackSize

[Og II]
* Added processing for contract management add / abandon.
* Removed update script I added back on 10/14 to fix the burden of the weenie for the MMD note.   This is no lonager needed - use Dereth v0.2.4 or greater the issue has been 
* resolved in the data and the script is no longer needed.
* Minor code cleanup and improved some method documentation.
* Added new table to store persisted tracked contracts (quests)
* Implemented two new game events / SendClientContractTrackerTable and SendClientContractTracker
* Implemented abandon quest - Game action - Social_AbandonContract
* Documeted methods and updated trello.
* To test @ci 44163 -create a contract.   Use the contract and you are now tracking that quest.   You can create any contract using ci or buy one from a vendor if they are In
* did not check vendors.   You can abandon the contract.   All management and the cooldown delay of 2 seconds is respected.

### 2017-10-18
[StackOverflow]
* Vendors - Fixed bug with sell of item from wielded locations
* Inventory - Major Refractor of Code. (many conditional bugs fixed)
* Fixed server crash bug on dropping wielded items (items now drop to ground np)
* Fixed bug with dropping clothing / armor to landblock

### 2017-10-17
[Jyrus]
* Reconfigured and renamed functions to account for Potions being included in class Food
* Wired up applying the chosen starting town to the Training Academy path used

[StackOverflow]
* Vendors are no longer free!
* Pyreals as currency has been added.
* @setcoin added for debugging of sync of coinValue gets away during dev.

### 2017-10-16
[Jyrus]
* Implemented Food class for consuming food items
* Stub created for handling Buffing food but implementation is not complete, as spellcasting has not been completed, yet
* Implemented a method for removing an item from inventory that also handles item stacks.
* Included a fix for stack splitting to create proper WorldObject, instead of defaulting everything to GenericObjects
[StackOverflow]
* Made all vendors free as long as you have some money in your pack
* Prepping for real pyreal transactions.
* Fixed Packs, you can now buy packs and use them without the need to relog

### 2017-10-14
[Og II]
* Added processing for merge items.
* Added script to update the burden, value and stack size of the weenie for MMD notes I used in testing.   20630 - value 250,000 burden 5 and stacksize 1

### 2017-10-13
[Og II]
* Added processing for item inscription. Implemented Set Inscription and Inscription Response messages. 
* Inscriptions persist to the database and can be removed.  
* Implemented first pass of same inscriber check. Sends error message and does not update the item. This may need to be revisited, I * * thought it blocked you from changing it - not sure if that was a weenie error sent to client - I did not see a fail inscribe in live * pcaps. It does check the inscribable flag and will prevent any pre-inscribed items (quest items with inscriptions from being altered. * Thanks @LtRipley36706 for pointing that out.

### 2017-10-12
[Ripley]
* Added Burden tracking to Players and Containers.
* Added CoinValue tracking via objects of WeenieType.Coin to Players and Containers.
* Added Value tracking to Containers.
* Commented out areas related to above changes that were not implemented correctly.
* TODO: Update Value/Burden and track changes as StackSize adjustments occur.
* TODO FIXME: Vendors code need to be adjusted to work with pyreal objects, not CoinValue direct.

### 2017-10-11
[StackOverflow]
* Added support for unique Vendor Items.
* Added a new Debug Cmd, @setcoin value for testing purposes.
* Major Vendor Code refractor, vendor now only load items for sale and not items they should be wielding.

### 2017-10-06
[Jyrus]
* Moved WeenieType keys into their own class and implemented unlocking doors via keys

[Immortalbob]
* Added equipmentset.cs to house the equipment set enums for future use.

### 2017-10-05
[Immortalbob]
* Identified unknown enums 381 382 383 384 387 388 389 and updated acecharacter.cs and propertyint.cs.

[Mogwai]
* Modified vendor stuff to use buy and sell rates from DoubleProperties

### 2017-10-04
[Jyrus]
* Moved handling of the Portals into the HandleOnCollide method and implemented MoveTo for OnUse for Portals.  Currently, OnUse also queues up portaling
	via a direct call to Portal.HandleOnCollide, which can be removed when collision is implemented.
  
[StackOverflow]
* Added Vendors (Go buy stuff!) - work in progress
* Added Debug command to give coins.
* @addcoin 100000
* known issue with pyreals in inventory.. drop them on the ground if you want the math to be correct for now.

### 2017-10-03
[OptimShi]
* Added method to get animation timings out of MotionTable and updated several instances where we were faking it previously.

[Og II]
* Added update script to modify defaultCombatStance ace_object_properties_int to match change with @OptimShi changes of 10/02
* Rolled back [ServerOnly] attribute on enums.   I left the mechanism in place and tagged all over 9000 as such.   Our method for determining
* this is not correct.   We can add these back when we fully understand which are truly not needed by the client.

### 2017-10-02
[OptimShi]
* Changed MotionCommand and MotionState enums to full uint instead of short and adjusted the movement serializing functions to work with these changes.
* Fixed bug when leaving CombatMode with no ammunition equipped (e.g. melee or magic mode)
* Added "acecommands" tip to console start up
* Corrected an issue with the palette of head gear chosen at character creation.

[Og II]
* Initial work on content interactions.
* Cleaned up the using statements on several files.
* Aligned the enums to = sign
* Fixed bug in universal motion using the TurnToObject
* Added enum attributes for all of our property enums per Mogwai using the data from OptimShi found here
* http://ac.yotesfan.com/ace_object/not_used_enums.php
* WIP need to filer out sending of aceObject properties using this information.   I am stuck on the lambda expression.   
* see line 74 in GameEventPlayerDescription.   Any help appreciated.
* NOTE: the big gotcha with this is if we have any of the [ServerOnly] attributes set incorrectly, that data will not get sent to the client
* and if you don't remember that we are filtering by that attribute you will be going what the hell is wrong.   Just an FYI

[Immortal Bob]
* Identified and changed enum Unknown_386 to Overpower.

[Ripley]
* Added WeenieType.Coin handler.
* Wired up CoinValue and attached proper tracking to WeenieType.Container handler.
  - Proper stack splitting or pickup of items that allow stacking still not handled by server.
  - Correct mathing requires base WeenieType.Coin weenies in database be set correctly. Value/StackSize need to be set to single value initally.
  - ACE-World will need to be updated to fix base values.

### 2017-10-01
[Og II]
* Initial work on content interactions.
* Cleaned up the using statements on several files.
* Aligned the enums to = sign
* Fixed bug in universal motion using the TurnToObject

### 2017-09-30
[Ripley]

* Fixed saving books to the Shard database.
* Characters now equip items on world entry. (This will reveal bugs in clothing layer priority and model change issues)

### 2017-09-25
[Og II]
* Implemented persisting of wielded items.   
* Changed inventory to manage a list of world objects instead of ace objects.   This was needed for sequence issues.
* fixed combat animation that had been broken for a while due to prior refactoring.
* fixed moving inventory from container to container with persistances which was broken due to prior refactoring.
* implemented the response message to send object description.
* cleaned up so code, aligned enums.
* TODO.   I have a dirty flag bug that causes issues when you do container to container moves and save.   
* Not sure if you want to accept this with a known bug - it has changed a lot and is probably holding others up.

### 2017-09-20
[Ripley]
* Added a minimum UseRadius to Doors. This prevents the radius being so small as to require you to be inside the door to open/close it.

### 2017-09-18
[Mogwai]
* Starter clothing done.  other stuff WIP.
* Modified recipe table to items resulting from failure
* Updated recipe manager to create the appropriate items on failure

### 2017-09-15
[Mogwai]
* Modified recipe table to support heal kits
* Implemented heal kit usage (known bugs around sequences and GameMessagePublicUpdatePropertyInt as well as current health)

### 2017-09-05
[OptimShi]
* Added Palette (0x04...) parsing from the client_portal.dat.
* Added PhysicsScript (0x33...) parsing from the client_portal.dat.
* Added PhysicsScriptTable (0x34...) parsing from the client_portal.dat.

### 2017-09-03
[Ripley]
* Changed GeneratorFactory to use WorldObjectFactory.CreateNewWorldObject insted of CreateWorldObject for now.

[OptimShi]
* Added Wave (0x0A...) parsing from the client_portal.dat and a "wave-export" console function to save as a playable .wav file.
* Added GfxObjDegradeInfo (0x11..) parsing from the client_portal.dat 
* Added CombatManeuverTable (0x30...) parsing from the client_portal.dat 
* Added ParticleEmitterInfo (0x32...) parsing from the client_portal.dat 

### 2017-09-01
[OptimShi]
* Added Region (0x13...) parsing from the client_portal.dat
* Added Scene (0x12...) parsing from the client_portal.dat

### 2017-08-27
[Ripley]

**NOTE: The following changes require ACE-World version 0.2.0 or greater.**
* Changed Landblock initailization code to use ace_landblock instances.
  This change reduces database size and creation time significantly as well as faciltates easier worldbuilding operations going forward.
* Uncommented weenieHeaderFlags2 from AceObject.
* Rebased Shard and World SQL scripts and removed update scripts.

### 2017-08-24
[rtmruczek]
* Added support for creating and leaving a Fellowship. The current implementation is racy, but serves as an example for future work on Fellowships.

### 2017-08-16
[Zegeger]
* Rewrote packetizer code to fix incorrect multi-fragment messages (basically we shouldn't send optional headers when a single fragment fills the full packet)
* In general this made the packetizer much cleaner and more organized
* In the process I added support for premptive tail sending.  Essentially for multifragment packets, the last fragment will likely be much smaller then the full packet size, so it could fit in an earlier message among other fragments.  We see this can occur in production network traces (eg the last index arrives as the first fragment of the message). Previously we did not do this, but now we can.

### 2017-08-15
[OptimShi]
* Fixed book properties not cloning properly.
* Added Animation parsing from the client_portal.dat and all relevant hooks and properties.

### 2017-08-11
[OptimShi]
* Fixed bug with the components in spells that had extended characters (>7bit) in their name or description.

[Og II]
This is getting so large, I need to stop here - this is a good spot - adds significant functionality but with a few known bugs.
* Inventory will save with the container and load again in the correct positions.
* Character Description Event is now wired up for inventory.
* removed containers copy of aceObject Inventory - just make the list accessible.
* Updated Clone so it you pass a new guid, it resets all the associated child tables.
* implemented placement IntProperty 65 used to track slot in Container
* Created supporting methods to manage pack order
* Enhanced the debug log message for DBDEBUG
* Small temp fix to stutter when attempting to shift walk or shift jump. We still need to really understand autonomous
* Created new view vw_ace_inventory_object to expose ability to pull by container.
* general clean up comments and whitespace
* Inventory loading - working
TODO:
* Add in capacity checks
* bug still in picking up items off the ground and saving to database.
* bug with reloaded items saved in a secondary side pack.

### 2017-08-10
[Ripley]
* Minor changes to Book weenie.

[OptimShi]
* Added MotionTable parsing to DatLoader.
* Added GetSpellFormula() function to SpellTable. Will return component id's based on players account name for any given spell.
* Fixed some logic issues in the SpellComponentsTable

### 2017-08-08
[OptimShi]
* NOTE: The following change requires ACE-World database v0.1.9 or newer to make use of.
* Added ability to read books, notes, etc. (Currently read-only)
* Added Database Update scripts to Shard and World for new ace_object_properties_book

### 2017-08-07
[Ripley]
* Wired up World Broadcast commands.
* Cleaned up a few other commands that were not needed or found in other catagories.

### 2017-08-06
[Ripley]
* Added Scroll weenie object.

### 2017-08-02
[Ripley]
* NOTE: The following changes require ACE-World database v0.1.8 or newer...
* Added NpcLooksLikeObject check for Creature assessment profile fix provided by @OptimShi.
* Moved Default do nothing UseDone to WorldObject and removed it from GenericObject.
* Added Cow weenie object.
* Added Cow, Creature, and Container to the WorldObjectFactory.
* Say Hi to the cow in Holtburg.
* Load attributes stored in world database into objects.

### 2017-07-31
[OptimShi]
* Added check to ensure a player can't spend more attribute credits than they should at character creation.

### 2017-07-30
[Og II]
* Added spell bar management and persistence.   This continues the work for learning and persisting spells.   
* Cleaned up some of the enum duplication in GameEventPlayerDescription.cs
* Added some debug code around universal motion.
* Added some debug asserts in PlayerDescription 
* To test - use @learnspell to get some spells in your spell book if you do not have any.   They will persist with your character. 
* You can also unlearn them and they will be removed.
* Now, drag your spells into any configuration in your spell bars you like.   You can add them, remove them or reorder them.
* They will be saved on our periodic save, or when you log out or you can force a save with the debug command @save-now.
* Added table to persist spell bar configuration.
* That's all for this PR.   

### 2017-07-29

* Generic OnUse just sends UseDone
* Reorganized WorldObject class file, made changes to PhysicsDesc to align with client expectations.

### 2017-07-28
[Zegeger]
* Tweaked the ACK timer to help improve network reliability

[Og II]
* Spent 5 or 6 hours tracking down an align bug in create object - Universial Motion section.   Damn it Jim, I am a high level programmer not a down in the bits and bytes weenie.... :)

### 2017-07-25
[Ripley]
* Minor change to QueryItemMana based on PCAPs.

### 2017-07-24
[Lidefeath]
* Added GameAction and GameEvent for querying an items Mana.

[Og II]
* Refactored debug command learn spell.
* Made spells persist to the database.
* Added abilty to delete spell from spell book and send that persistantly to the database on character save.
* TODO: Put in the abilty to use scrolls to learn spells.

[Ripley]
* Added Bools used by ObjectDescriptionFlag and PhysicsState.
* Added WeenieType to PropertyInt Enum for future use.
* Changed GameMessageServerName to include connection count and max.
* Changed the way PhysicsDescriptionFlag, PhysicsState, WeenieHeaderFlag and WeenieHeaderFlag2 are set and sent to the client.
* Even more changes to main object flags.
* Wired up /mrt command.
* /mrt was used by admins to bypass the housing barriers. I used it to prove out ObjectDescriptionFlag state changes.
* Note that you have to have manually set the Admin flag on ObjectDescriptionFlag in the code for this command to work, See Player.cs constructor section.

### 2017-07-21
[Ripley]
* Moved Identify Serializes and Writers to WorldObject and Creature as appropriate.
* Changed the way Workmanship is set so to not always default to 0 if ItemWorkmanship was null.

* Fixed StyleCop issue in AbilityFormulaAttribute.
* Fix for SetupModel bug provided by @OptimShi.

### 2017-07-20
[Lidefeath]
* Fix raising primary and secondary attributes.
* Aligned the enums PropertyAttribute.Quickness and PropertyAttribute.Coordination with the client.
* Due to this alignment old chars will have wrong coord and quick, so make new characters.
* I didn't touch the trigger of VitalTicks yet, so vital ticking is only enabled during Player.Load().

### 2017-07-17
[Ripley]
* More field changes.
* More new character defaults set.
* Fixed Guid assignment for new players and generated objects.
* Move Guid range assignments to ObjectGuid, GuidManager reads them in from there now.
* Changes to WorldObject, Door and Generator classes.
* Changed Debug Output to chat window only to allow for proper ID display.
* Reworked Door.cs.
* Locked Doors are now now locked and act accordingly.
* Multiple changes to AceObject and AceCharacter.

### 2017-07-14
[Og II]
* Initial work on combat mode.   System now will move into and out of the correct combat mode depending on what items you have equipped.
* TODO: There are some edge cases I still need to implement and additional testing.   I would like to get this in so that I do not run into huge merge issues later on.
* Testing - you can log in - run @weapons after log in.   This will get you various weapons based on weapon type.   You can go into and out of combat mode
* Melee, missile - both bow and xbow, thrown, sword, UA, two handed as well as dual wield.    I also implemented if you remove your weapon while in combat mode, 
* you will drop into unarmed.   If you equip an item and you are not in peace mode, you will assume the correct combat mode.   There may be some tweaking needed 
* for changing combat mode in combat mode - I think it did some slower animation - but the basics are in and I can tweak the sequence once I talk to players or If
* I can find a pcap with that behavior.

### 2017-07-12
[Ripley]
* Moved most of the enums under ACE.Network to ACE.Entity.
* Changed some properties of new characters to set proper title defaults and DOB.
* Moved writers out of Player and into GameEventIdentifyObjectResponse.

### 2017-07-11
[Ripley]
* Removed events from SQL scripts. No longer need them in current implementation.
* Renamed ObjectType to ItemType.
* Added Sequences for Health/Stamina/Mana for proper updating later.
* Set slew of initial values for new characters.
* Added PlayerKillerStatus, CreatureType, and WeenieType enums.

### 2017-07-10
[Og II]
* Fixed bug with animation - isAutonomous flag was incorrectly set and fix for limping broke animation. (Me)   This should allow both to work correctly.

### 2017-07-09
[Ripley]
* Changed the way deleting a character works. Instead of having the SQL server poll, the act of connecting to the server triggers the check.
* If character's delete timer is up, the next time you log in, the character is deleted before sending you the list.

[ddevec]
* Changed SerializedShardDatabase to use a BlockingCollection to stop busy polling of DB requests.
* Updated GuidManager to properly initialize current allocation Guids.
* Added support in databases for the queries requried to initialize Guids.

### 2017-07-08
[Ripley]
* Rebased SQL scripts.
* Updated README to reflect new database update procedures.
* Changed GuidManager ranges to reflect ACE-World usage.
* More tweaks to debug output upon object assessment.
* Fixed some Enum errors and misspellings.

[Og II]
* Fixed issue with MotionStateFlag - setting now by the existance of data like we do with all other flags.   This prevents data / flag mismatch.

### 2017-07-07
[OptimShi]
* Added "@barbershop" debug command and corresponding functionality to load the interface, and save and apply settings.
* Changed some CharGen types that were ushort to uints. (They were short for legacy reasons no longer needed)

[Og II]
* Initial work on splitting a stackable item.   This is working and in an action chain.   Right now, it is only working for items 
* in your position.   I need to extend it to work with items in chests and off the ground.   
* There is some new type of sequence that we need to research and implement.   I put a big todo in the code.
* I made some posts about getting guid manager going.   We are at a point where we need it.   I modified some of the ranges to make better use
* of our guid space.   
* TODO - find out about sequence and then do stack which is the complement function from split.

### 2017-07-06
[Ripley]
* Required ACE-World database version: v0.1.4
* Rolled in PR #430 from @Lidefeath as starting base. 
* Added generator links table to WorldBase.
* Made changes to GuidManger and ObjectGuid in an effort to avoid collisions with guids already present in ACE-World. Does not persist or track, resets each server start.

* Speaking of Drudges, there is a drudge invasion south and west of Holtburg.
* Several changes to 06-06-30-2017-generator-chains-testdata.sql found in Database/Updates/World to set up for generator instances and show examples of them.

* Started the removal of DebugObject - NPC's now spawn as creatures and containers now spawn as containers.  Need to finish this work.
* Appraisal Event is 90% coded.   All stats (int, bool, string, int64, DataId and Double) as sent and coded.   Armor, creature, spell and weapon profiles are 
* complete.   TODO: Hook profiles and enchantment bitfields as well as base armor status for coverage 
* Basic infrastructure for the correct motion stance is in place.   Normally I would not have included this WIP code, but it has no negative impact and I started in the wrong 
* branch.   It would be a pain to pull it out.   If possible, I would like to add this as is - with the note that I will complete this next.

### 2017-06-16
[OptimShi]
* Added SpellTable/SpellComponent parsing from portal.dat. Also added "@learnspell" debug command and corresponding UpdateSpell Event. (Added back in after OO merge)

* cleaned up and rebased data scripts for WorldBase and ShardBase
* Found issue in my data that was ETL to our new schema - had two flag fields Reversed - that is fixed but would be no issue
* once we have Ripley's new data export.   I have shared out a link to the cleaned up data for use while we finish the new export.
* https://www.dropbox.com/s/pohcruvalt9s38h/WorldandShardData.zip?dl=0
* I put in a nasty hack - hard coded weenieClassId on character save - it was being set to 0 and I could not find it.   I marked with with a todo.
* player.cs line 490

[ddevec]
* Somewhat cleaned up CreatureAbility and CreatureSkill in-game and backend separation

### 2017-06-06
[OptimShi]
* Read character creation values from client_portal.dat and assign to appropriate Character Properties.

* TODO items:
*	Finish up loading positions then see what is left. 
*	Work on saving as OptimShi - has character creation ready to go.   

### 2017-05-21
[Og II]
* Intital work done for new schema.   Rebased and removed update sql files.
* Tested and the auto setting of Physics and Weenie Header Flags looks really solid.   Side note, the values we have
* in the database for weenieHeaderFlags and PhysicsDescriptionFlag should probably be dropped we don't read them or use them now.
* Doors, portals NPC's and signs are all back in the world now.
* I would suggest we remearge with the main branch sooner rather than later - we can create another branch to introduce these
* changes into the character side.
* TODO items:
*	Creature spawns need to be refactored - I left them commented out.   We need to ditch seperate tables that we have now, I think all 
*	creature can use what we have now, plus maybe two additional world tables.   Everything else fits into the current schema.
*	Test Ripley data and update ACE_World.   
*	Refactor portals - I just left the old way in and faked it out with a view.  
*	Once this looks good and stable and we fix any found bugs - we need to clone this over to the character database and start refactoring
*	That will get us to persisted inventory.   

### 2017-05-21
[Og II]
* Continued work on Overhaul 
* re-enabled more constructed statements
* Most of the work to use existance of data to set flags for both phyics and weenieHeaderFlags - some cleanup remains - either logic issues or bad data
* modifed cirand to take an optional second parameter to spawn X items at a time.   This speeds up testing.   I set a default to 10 if you ommit the second parameter.
* base_ace_object and ace_object both seem to be loading.
* updated or created several views.
* have not tested with Ripley's new data export - I did not want to add a second variable to testing.   
* Next steps - use Ripley's data, create needed views, re-enable door, portal, NPC --- all the world things.

### 2017-05-17
[Og II]
* Continued work on Overhaul 
* Created mapping cross reference file to faciltate docuatation and cleaning up names - work in progress https://goo.gl/eaaNQb
* Created new database schema for world_object - modified mysqlinstall.bat to refect new baseline
* created script to ETL old schema to new schema.   I have not included it as we will be refactoring the initial data load to use the new
* schema according to Ripley.   I have the script tested and posted on my dropbox if anyone wants it.   I also have a complete data dump that
* zips down to a manageable size.
* BaseAceObject is now using the new schema
* I re-hooked up telepoi to use the new schema.   Still to do, convert to constructed statement
* Next steps - refactor AceObject and make sure world objects load again.
* Once that is complete - start same process using clone of this schema for character as discussed.

### 2017-05-12
[Og II]
* Started object Overhaul - added explicit values to properties enums.   Minor cleanup.

* Updated `PositionType` for Positions, too prevent position types outside of the definition from entering the database.

[Og II]
* Refactored ctw to admin commands ci and create both take parameter of a weenieId.   You can spawn anything in the database.   @ci 21376 - will spawn Martine's Robe   This does not include the turn to object code - I pulled that out due to a bug.   I will submit via new PR.

### 2017-05-01

* Can be tested with the new debug command MoveTo <40>  - the parameter is optional.   The default is 30 if you do not put a parameter.   You can test the walk run
* by setting any distance for the wand to spawn under 15.  If you use moveto 10 - your character will walk to the wand.    If you type moveto 90 - he will run a long way.

[MiachofTD]
* Added 30 portals in the destination_portal for Gharu towns.
