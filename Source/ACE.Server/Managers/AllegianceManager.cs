            // Vassal-to-patron pass-up has no effective cap, but patron-to-grandpatron pass-up caps with an effective Loyalty of 175.
            // If you're sworn for 10 days to the same patron, the base Loyalty required to maximize the pass-up from your vassal through you to your patron is only 88.
            // Take into account level 7 enchantments, and you can see how there's practically no need to spend XP on the skill, due to the ease in reaching the cap.
            // Leadership is arguably worse off. In theory, you need to train Leadership and spend XP on it in order to get maximum results.
            // However, effective Leadership is multiplied by two factors: how many vassals you have, and how long they have been sworn to you, with the emphasis on the number of vassals you have.
            // The effect of Leadership on pass-up caps at around 165 effective Leadership, or 83 base Leadership before the modifier.
            // The end result of this is that if you have two active vassals and you can get 10 mules sworn underneath you for an average of 5 in-game days,
            // you never need to raise your Leadership beyond 83. Again, take into account level 7 enchantments and you can see why few people even bother training the skill. It's just too easy to reach the cap. 

            // Post-patch:
            // - Leadership and Loyalty are not based on Self attribute
            // - Effective Loyalty is still modified by the time you have spent sworn to your patron
            // - Effective Leadership is still modified by number of vassals and average time that they have been sworn to you,
            //   but the emphasis is on the "time sworn" side and not on the "number of vassals" side. In fact, the vassals
            //   required to achieve the maximum benefit has been decreased from 12 to 4. This is to reduce the incentive of having non-playing vassals.
            // - For both Loyalty and Leadership, the time sworn modifier will now be a factor of both in-game time and real time.
            // - Most importantly, Leadership and Loyalty no longer "cap"

            // XP pass-up:
            // - New minimums and maximums
            // - Vassal-to-patron pass-up will have a minimum of 25% of earned XP, and a maximum of 90% of earned XP.
            //   Under the old system, the minimum was about 9% of earned XP, and the effective maximum was somewhere near 44% of earned XP.
            // - Patron-to-grandpatron pass-up will have a minimum of 0% of XP passed-up by the patron's vassal, and a maximum of 10% of passed-up XP.
            //   Under the old system, the minimum was about 30% and the maximum was about 94%.
