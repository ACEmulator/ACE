            // Original formula:

            // - When you are level 5 or under, you don't drop anything when you die.
            // - From level 6 to level 10, you lose half your coins (not trade notes) and nothing else.
            // - From level 11 to level 20, you lose half your coins and possibly one non-wielded item (that is, something that you were neither wearing nor holding in your hands).
            // - From level 21 to level 35, you lose half your coins and some number of non-wielded items.
            // - After level 35, you lose half your coins and some number of items. At this point, you can drop items that you were wearing or holding.

            // Now, in those last two cases, I said 'some number'. Some number here is equal to your level divided by 10, rounded down, plus a random number between 0 and 2.
            // So from level 21 to 29 you can lose between 2 and 4 items; from level 30 to 39 you can lose 3-5 items; from 40-49 you can lose 4-6 items, and so forth.
            // By level 126 you can be losing up to 14 items.

            // (one caveat here: if you were killed in a PK battle, you always lose items as if you were over level 35, although the exact number you lose
            // is still determined by your real level / 10. In other words, PK deaths do not get the special protection from item loss that NPK deaths get under level 35.)

            // So that's how many items you lose on death -- but how do we determine which items are lost? This is where the categories come into it.

            // Each item in the game has a particular item type associated with it. The actual types (categories) are listed below.
            // When we are deciding what items you drop on death, we make a list of all the items you are carrying, sorted by value (high value first).
            // But we may adjust their values in two ways. If the item is not the most valuable item in that category, then we cut its value in half.
            // And whether or not it is the most valuable item in its category, we randomize its value a little bit to mix things up.
            // (To answer your first question explicitly, the cutting-the-value-in-half is not cumulative -- the second- and third- and fourth-most valuable items
            // of one category all have their values halved, not halved and then quartered and then eighthed).

            // Now note that we still keep these things in a list sorted by adjusted value -- so its possible to have your two expensive weapons
            // listed first and second, if the value of the second weapon cut in half is still higher than the value of the third item. What I am trying to get at here is
            // that we do not segregate the list based on item type; we only use item type to determine how we adjust the value of the item.

            // Finally, we go down the list and mark the first # things as dropped, where # is the number of items we have calculated that you are going to drop this death.
            // For instance, if you are level 48, you will drop the first 4-6 items on that list.

            // The categories of items are:

            // - Melee weapons
            // - Missile weapons
            // - Magic casters (like orbs & wands)
            // - Armor
            // - Clothing
            // - Jewelry
            // - Food
            // - Gems
            // - Components
            // - Mana stones
            // - Crafting ingredients
            // - Parchments & books
            // - Keys
            // - Tradenotes
            // - Miscellaneous

            // A few categories are left out such as lifestones -- because you aren't likely to be carrying an item of that type.

            // http://asheron.wikia.com/wiki/Death_Penalty
            // The first item to drop will be the highest value item regardless of type.
            // All items of the same type will now be counted at half their face value. This process repeats (next highest value item,
            // if an item of the same type has already dropped, the face value is halved.)

            // The number of items you drop can be reduced with the Clutch of the Miser augmentation. If you get the
            // augmentation three times you will no longer drop any items (except half of your Pyreals and all Rares except if you're a PK).
            // If you drop no items, you will not leave a corpse.

            // Some players use gems, particularly the Archmage Portal Gems as death items, so it's important to note how
            // stackable items work with the death system. When you die, a stack is considered to be one item for the purposes
            // of death items. However if that stack is selected, only one item off the stack will drop. For example, let's say you
            // can currently cover all of your items with 5 Portal Gems. After the event, if you do not stack these gems, there
            // will be no change. However, if you combine the 5 Gems into a single stack, you would drop 1 gem and 4 other items on death.

            // When you die there is a notification in your chat dialog stating what items you dropped, and your corpse location
            // (if on the landscape). If you do not leave a corpse the notification will state so.

            // Accounts with the Throne of Destiny expansion received a new formula for death items to prevent losing a
            // pack per death at high levels. The formula was changed to divide by 20 levels instead of 10, thereby making
            // the maximum dropped items the same.
            // Tier 1 and 2 Rares will always drop, and do not count toward your death item count, so store them in a safe place.
            // PKLite - no items or pyreals are lost on PKL death.

            // Death items

            // You can protect important items like your armor and weapons by carrying death items. THese are items that are
            // ideally light weight as well as high in value. You can tinker loot items with bags of Salvaged Gold to raise their
            // face value. Although tinkering special items can remove some of the beneift, as you feel obligated to recover
            // them. Items that can be purchased can just be left if the corpse would be too difficult to recover.

            // Popular items to use as Death Items:

            // - Massive Mana Charges (most common death item)
            // - Pristine Mana Shards
            // - Crowns (tinkered with gold)
            // - Robes sold by the Mastermages
            // - Nanner Island Portal Gems (somewhat difficult to obtain)

            // Bonded items:

            // Items that have the Special Property Bonded will never drop on death. Some notable bonded items include:
            // - Academy Weapons (Starter weapons)
            // - Augmentation Gems (Asheron's Benediction and Blackmoor's Favor)
            // - Pathwarden Armor (Starter armor)
            // - Trade Notes

            // Recovering from Death

            // Fortunately, you won't be in immediate danger of being killed again, because you're invulnerable to attack for a full minute if you don't attack another
            // creature of cast any spells. Also, your secondary attributes, even if all had been reduced to 0 when you died, will be at 75 percent of their new
            // maximum score, and any poisons or harmful enchantments afflicting you just before you died will be gone, giving you a fighting chance of making it
            // back to town or meeting up with your allies.
            // You can also find the location of your last corpse outdoors by typing @corpse.

            // Corpse timer = Math.Max(1 hour, 5 mins * level)

            // You can have up to 20 people in your consent list at once. However, when you log off, all permissions to loot corpses will be removed.

            // First, we sort the inventory by order of value.
            // Second, we go back through the inventory starting at the most expensive item and look at each item's category.
            // If we've seen the item category before, we divide the value of the item in half.
            // At this point, we add a random 0-10% variance to each item's value.

            // - From level 6 to level 10, you lose half your coins (not trade notes) and nothing else.
            // - From level 11 to level 20, you lose half your coins and possibly one non-wielded item (that is, something that you were neither wearing nor holding in your hands).
            // - From level 21 to level 35, you lose half your coins and some number of non-wielded items.
            // - After level 35, you lose half your coins and some number of items. At this point, you can drop items that you were wearing or holding.

            // Now, in those last two cases, I said 'some number'. Some number here is equal to your level divided by 10 (*20 after patch), rounded down, plus a random number between 0 and 2.
            // So from level 21 to 29 you can lose between 2 and 4 items; from level 30 to 39 you can lose 3-5 items; from 40-49 you can lose 4-6 items, and so forth.
            // By level 126 you can be losing up to 14 items.

            // (one caveat here: if you were killed in a PK battle, you always lose items as if you were over level 35, although the exact number you lose
            // is still determined by your real level / 10. In other words, PK deaths do not get the special protection from item loss that NPK deaths get under level 35.)

            // So that's how many items you lose on death -- but how do we determine which items are lost? This is where the categories come into it.

            // take augments into consideration?
