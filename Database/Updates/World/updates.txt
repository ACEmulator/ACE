===========================================
Rebased all database scripts.

Run 05 only after you have world data loaded.   Not added to appveyor bat file for that reason.

The scripts in this folder are structure additions/changes that are not contained in the base scripts.  The Base script, which is a SQL Dump, should generally contain this data, though it is not always up to date.
