# ACEmulator Core Server
**ACEmulator is a custom, completely from-scratch open source server implementation for Asheron's Call built on C#**
 * MySQL and MariaDB are used as the database engine.
 * Latest client supported.
 * Currently intended for developers that wish to contribute to the ACEmulator project.

***
## Recommended Tools
* SQLYog [on Github](https://github.com/webyog/sqlyog-community/wiki/Downloads)
* Hex Editor (Hexplorer or 010 Editor are both good)
* ACLogView [on Github](https://github.com/tfarley/aclogview)

## Getting Started

* Install MySQL (MariaDB is preferred, but either will work).
* Create three databases named `ace_auth`, `ace_character`, and `ace_world`.
* Load AuthenticationBase.sql, CharacterBase.sql, and WorldBase.sql for their respective databases. 
* Load all incremental SQL updates in the Database\Updates sub directories. 
* Copy `Config.json.example` to `Config.json` and modify database settings, such as your database password.
* Build and run ACE.
* Create an account at the prompt - `accountcreate testaccount testpassword`
* Launch AC - `acclient.exe -a testaccount -h 127.0.0.1:9000 -glsticketdirect testpassword`
