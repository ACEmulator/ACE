## Getting Started

**For a more detailed installation process, please see [this excellent write up](https://shinobyte.gitbooks.io/shinobyte-knowledge-repository/content/acemu/acemu-server-installation.html) by "Immortus"**
* Install MySQL
  - [MySQL minimum required version - 5.7.17+](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html)
  - [MariaDB minimum required version - 10.2+](https://mariadb.org/download/)
* Create two databases named `ace_auth`, `ace_shard`.
* Load AuthenticationBase.sql and ShardBase.sql for their respective databases. 
* Load all incremental SQL updates found in the Database\Updates\Authentication sub directory in the order of oldest to newest.
* Load all incremental SQL updates found in the Database\Updates\Shard sub directory in the order of oldest to newest.
* Create a final database named `ace_world`.
* Load WorldBase.sql to initialize the ace_world database. 
* Download from [ACE-World](https://github.com/ACEmulator/ACE-World) the [latest release](https://github.com/ACEmulator/ACE-World/releases/latest) of world data, extract and load into your ace_world database.
  - [ACE-World minimum required version - 0.3.0+](https://github.com/ACEmulator/ACE-World/releases/latest)
* Load all incremental SQL updates found in the Database\Updates\World sub directory in the order of oldest to newest.
* Copy `ACE\Config.json.example` to `Config.json` and modify settings, such as passwords and other server settings.
* Copy `ACE.CmdLineLauncher\launcher_config.json.example` to `launcher_config.json` and modify your launcher settings to correspond with your ACE\config.json settings.
* Build and run ACE, ACE.Api.Host, and ACE.CmdLineLauncher.
* Create your first account as an admin at the ACE prompt - `accountcreate testaccount testpassword 5`
* Launch AC with the CmdLineLauncher or directly with this command: `acclient.exe -a testaccount -h 127.0.0.1:9000 -glsticketdirect null`

## API

Once running, you can browse the APIs by adding "/swagger" to the hosted endpoints.  For example, the game server api defaults to run on port 8000, and you could browse to http://localhost:8000/swagger for the documentation.

## FAQ

#### 1. StyleCop.MSBuild.targets not found
* _Problem_
> When opening the solution, you get a "The imported project "{project path}\ACE\Source\packages\StyleCop.MSBuild.5.0.0\build\StyleCop.MSBuild.targets" was not found. Confirm that the path in the <Import> declaration is correct, and that the file exists on disk" error.
* _Solution_
> Right click "Solution 'ACE'" in the Solution Explorer and select "Restore Nuget Packages".  After it restores, right click "ACE (load failed)" and select "Reload Project."

#### 2. My PR failed because AppVeyor timed out - "Build execution time has reached the maximum allowed time for your plan (60 minutes)."
* _Problem_
>When you submit a PR, we have automation in place that automatically kicks off a build in AppVeyor.  These builds sometimes time out.  The most common cause is because a Debug.Assert statement was hit that popped up a UI dialog on AppVeyor.  However, because it's just running a command line tool, there's no way to click the popup.  Even worse, there's now way for you to even see what it says.
* _Solution_
> 1) Right click your solution in Visual Studio, select "Rebuild Solution" and make sure there are no compliation errors.
> 2) Installed with Visual Studio 2015 is "Developer Command Prompt for VS2015".  Open it up, and change to your "ACE\Source" directory.
> 3) Run the following command  and you'll be able to see the popup triggering the build failure.  
   `vstest.console /inIsolation "ACE.Tests\bin\x64\Debug\ACE.Tests.dll" /Platform:x64`

#### 3. Startup projects are not set / working
* _Problem_
> When you first load the solution and try to "run" the server, you may get a popup that says "A project with Output Type of Class Library cannot be started directly."
* _Solution_
> 1) Right click the Solution in Visual Studio ("Solution 'ACE' (16 projects)"), and select "Set StartUp Projects".
> 2) The following projects should have "Start" in the "Action" column: ACE, ACE.Api.Host, ACE.CmdLineLauncher.  If your server is configured to use secure authentication, also set ACE.AuthApi.Host to "Start".

#### 4. API.Host applications throw "Access is denied" errors
* _Problem_ When you first load the API Host or Auth Host applications, you may get an error message:
```cs
Unhandled Exception: System.Reflection.TargetInvocationException: Exception has been thrown by the target of an invocation. ---> System.Net.HttpListenerException: Access is denied
```
* _Solution_
In an administrative Windows command prompt add both port 8000 and 8001 to netsh's urlacl table: 
```powershell
netsh http add urlacl url=http://+:8000/ user=<YOUR USER ACCOUNT>
netsh http add urlacl url=http://+:8001/ user=<YOUR USER ACCOUNT>
```
